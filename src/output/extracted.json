        "title": "Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019",
        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute infection of the respiratory tract that emerged in late 2019 1,2 . Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% of cases with severe courses, and 6.1% of cases with critical courses 3 . This severe presentation may result from the virus using a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung 2,4 ; the same receptor tropism is thought to have determined the pathogenicity-but also aided in the control-of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 5 . However, there are reports of cases of COVID-19 in which the patient shows mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which suggests the potential for pre-or oligosymptomatic transmission [6][7][8] . There is an urgent need for information on virus replication, immunity and infectivity in specific sites of the body. Here we report a detailed virological analysis of nine cases of COVID-19 that provides proof of active virus replication in tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, with a peak at 7.11 \u00d7 10 8 RNA copies per throat swab on day 4. Infectious virus was readily isolated from samples derived from the throat or lung, but not from stool samples-in spite of high concentrations of virus RNA. Blood and urine samples never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by the presence of viral replicative RNA intermediates in the throat samples. We consistently detected sequence-distinct virus populations in throat and lung samples from one patient, proving independent replication. The shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (and by day 14 in all patients), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild illness of the upper respiratory tract. The confirmation of active virus replication in the upper respiratory tract has implications for the containment of COVID-19.RT-PCR, replication sites and infectivityTo first understand whether the described clinical presentations are solely caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, samples from all patients",

        "abstract": "Current urban water research involves intelligent sensing, systems integration, proactive users and datadriven management through advanced analytics. The convergence of building information modeling with the smart water field provides an opportunity to transcend existing operational barriers. Such research would pave the way for demand-side management, active consumers, and demand-optimized networks, through interoperability and a system of systems approach. This paper presents a semantic knowledge management service and domain ontology which support a novel cloud-edge solution, by unifying domestic socio-technical water systems with clean and waste networks at an urban scale, to deliver value-added services for consumers and network operators. The web service integrates state of the art sensing, data analytics and middleware components. We propose an ontology for the domain which describes smart homes, smart metering, telemetry, and geographic information systems, alongside social concepts. This integrates previously isolated systems as well as supply and demand-side interventions, to improve system performance. A use case of demand-optimized management is introduced, and smart home application interoperability is demonstrated, before the performance of the semantic web service is presented and compared to alternatives. Our findings suggest that semantic web technologies and IoT can merge to bring together large data models with dynamic data streams, to support powerful applications in the operational phase of built environment systems.",

        "abstract": "The development of Building Information Modelling provides a visual and information-rich environment to incorporate the construction risk knowledge in the domain of safety management. Ontology and semantic web technology offer an opportunity to enable such domain knowledge to be represented semantically. This paper attempts to take advantage of the strength of BIM, ontology and semantic web technology to establish an ontology-based methodology/framework for construction risk knowledge management in BIM environment. The risk knowledge is modelled into an ontology-based semantic network to produce a risk map, from which the interdependences between risks, risk paths can be inferred semantically. Based on the semantic retrieval mechanism, the applicable knowledge is dynamically linked to the specific objects in the BIM environment. Based on the methodology, a prototype system is developed as a tool to facilitate the construction risk knowledge management and reuse in hope of indirectly improving the construction risk analysis process. A case application is implemented to demonstrate the risk prevention through construction process/method selection, including the risk factors identification, risk paths reasoning and risk prevention plan recommendation. Finally, a questionnaire survey highlights the potential benefits and limitations on the deployment of such system.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in Session-based recommender systems have gained a ention due to their potential of providing real-time personalized recommendations with high recall, especially when compared to traditional methods like matrix factorization and item-based collaborative ltering. Nowadays, two of the most recent methods are Short-Term A ention/Memory Priority Model for Session-based Recommendation (STAMP) and Neural A entive Session-based Recommendation (NARM). However, when these two methods were applied in the similar-item recommendation dataset of Zalando (Fashion-Similar), they did not work out-of-the-box compared to a simple Collaborative-Filtering approach.Aiming for improving the similar-item recommendation, we propose to concentrate e orts on enhancing the rank of the few most relevant items from the original recommendations, by employing the information of the session of the user encoded by an a ention network.e e cacy of this strategy was con rmed when using a novel Candidate Rank Embedding that encodes the global ranking information of each candidate in the re-ranking process. Experimental results in Fashion-Similar show signi cant improvements over the baseline on Recall and MRR at 20, as well as improvements in Click rough Rate based on an online test. Additionally, it is important to point out from the evaluation that was performed the potential of this method on the next click prediction problem because when applied to STAMP and NARM, it improves the Recall and MRR at 20 on two publicly available real-world datasets.CCS CONCEPTS\u2022Retrieval tasks and goals \u2192 Recommender systems; \u2022Computing methodologies \u2192 Neural networks;",

        "abstract": "Dominant, truncating mutations of eyes absent 4 (EYA4) on chromosome 6q23 can cause either nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNA10 or hearing loss with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). It has been proposed that truncations of the Cterminal Eya domain cause DFNA10 whereas upstream truncations of the N-terminal variable region cause hearing loss with DCM. Here we report an extended family cosegregating autosomal dominant, postlingual-onset, progressive, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with a novel frameshift mutation, 1490insAA, of EYA4. The 1490insAA allele is predicted to encode a truncated protein with an intact Nterminal variable region, but lacking the entire C-terminal Eya domain. Clinical studies including electrocardiography, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart in nine affected family members revealed no DCM or associated abnormalities and confirmed their nonsyndromic phenotype. These are the first definitive cardiac evaluations of DFNA10 hearing loss to support a correlation of EYA4 mutation position with the presence or absence of DCM. These results will facilitate the counseling of patients with these phenotypes and EYA4 mutations.",

        "abstract": "Schemas, or internal representation models of the environment, are thought to be central in organising our everyday life behaviour by giving stability and predictiveness to the structure of the world. However, when an element from an unfolding event mismatches the schema-derived expectations, the coherent narrative is interrupted and an update to the current event model representation is required. Here, we asked whether the perceived incongruence of an item from an unfolding event and its impact on memory relied on the disruption of neural stability patterns preceded by the neural reactivation of the memory representations of the just-encoded event.Our study includes data from two different experiments whereby human participants ( N = 33, 26 females and N = 18, 16 females, respectively) encoded images of objects preceded by trial-unique sequences of events depicting daily routine. We found that neural stability patterns gradually increased throughout the ongoing exposure to a schema-consistent episode, which was corroborated by the re-analysis of data from two other experiments, and that the brain stability pattern was interrupted when the encoding of an object of the event was incongruent with the ongoing schema. We found that the decrease in neural stability for low-congruence items was seen at \u223c1000 ms from object encoding onset and that it was preceded by an enhanced N400 ERP and an increased degree of neural reactivation of the just-encoded episode. Current results offer new insights into the neural mechanisms and their temporal orchestration that are engaged during online encoding of schema-consistent episodic narratives and the detection of incongruencies.",

Using manually collected evidence of companies' support for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign, we find that speaking up in support of BLM attracts retail investor attention.

This effect is observed for companies that have black directors on their board and companies headquartered in Democratleaning states. There is no corresponding increase in firm value.

        "abstract": "An environmental-animal crisis is currently ongoing and is becoming increasingly severe due to human activity. However, the magnitude, timing, and processes related to this crisis are unclear. This paper clarifies the likely magnitude and timing of animal extinctions and changes in the contribution rates of select causes (global warming, pollution, deforestation, and two hypothetical nuclear conflicts) of animal extinctions during 2000-2300 CE. This paper demonstrates that an animal crisis marked by a 5-13% terrestrial tetrapod species loss and 2-6% marine animal species loss will occur in the next generation during 2060-2080 CE if humans do not engage in nuclear wars. These variations are due to magnitudes of pollution, deforestation, and global warming. The main causes of this crisis will change from pollution and deforestation to deforestation in 2030 under the low CO 2 emission scenarios but will change from pollution and deforestation to deforestation in 2070 and then to deforestation and global warming after 2090 under the medium CO 2 emissions. A nuclear conflict will increase animal species loss up to approximately 40-70% for terrestrial tetrapod species and 25-50% for marine animal species, including errors. Therefore, this study shows that the animal species conservation priority is to prevent nuclear war, reduce deforestation rates, decrease pollution, and limit global warming, in this order.",

        "abstract": "We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.",

        "abstract": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. * Equal contribution.

        "abstract": "Neurotransmitter receptors are key molecules in signal transmission, their alterations are associated with brain dysfunction. Relationships between receptors and their corresponding genes are poorly understood, especially in humans. We combined in vitro receptor autoradiography and RNA sequencing to quantify, in the same tissue samples (7 subjects), the densities of 14 receptors and expression levels of their corresponding 43 genes in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG) of human hippocampus. Significant differences in receptor densities between both structures were found only for metabotropic receptors, whereas significant differences in RNA expression levels mostly pertained ionotropic receptors. Receptor fingerprints of CA and DG differ in shapes but have similar sizes; the opposite holds true for their \"RNA fingerprints \", which represent the expression levels of multiple genes in a single area. In addition, the correlation coefficients between receptor densities and corresponding gene expression levels vary widely and the mean correlation strength was weak-to-moderate. Our results suggest that receptor densities are not only controlled by corresponding RNA expression levels, but also by multiple regionally specific post-translational factors.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism and generation of activity for methanol synthesis and the water gas shift reactions over copper-based catalysts remains a significant area of study in heterogeneous catalysis. In this work, steady and non-steady state experimental and kinetic modelling methods are presented to demonstrate changes in functionality of a Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst based on gas composition.Steady-state testing of a Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, using experimental spatial discretisation approaches with fixed-bed, integral-operation micro reactors, has generated performance data over a range of P CO / P CO2 ratios (1-10). The data showed a mixture of observations where forward or reverse water gas shift was kinetically favourable, and also where the reaction was significantly limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. A steady state Langmuir-Hinshelwood model based on micro kinetics was most appropriate which includes kinetic descriptions of both directions of the water gas shift reaction. Using this method, the entire dataset could be predicted and an internal consistency within the kinetic model of the key adsorption constants was demonstrated.Non-steady state, 'reactor start-up', testing of a Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst marked a novel approach to further understanding the functionality of the catalyst. Initial changes in surface carbon and oxygen populations were quantified and linked to subsequent dynamic changes in methanol synthesis and water gas shift activity. Cu/ZnO and Cu/Al 2 O 3 formulations were also evaluated and tested using kinetic models, permitting a structural and compositional comparison with Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 .",

        "abstract": "Flood water conservation realized through real-time multireservoir operations is effective in mitigating water scarcity. Owing to the influence of real-time inflow forecast uncertainty, determining an informed operation plan necessitates resolution of the conflict between upstream flood risk, downstream flood risk, and water scarcity risk. This study developed a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourses (MOSP) model to seek robust risk-averse plans under multiple risks. In the proposed approach, inflow forecast errors are modeled and sampled as spatially and temporally correlated stochastic processes using a copula function. The multiobjective stochastic programming is solved using the epsilon constraint method based on explicit formulation of multiple risk objectives with discretized inflow scenarios, and a rolling horizon with recourses for real-time operational updating is modeled to address the dynamic decision-making characteristics. The proposed methodologies were applied to the multireservoir system of the Pi River Basin (China), and comparisons with model results of a traditional coupled simulation and a deterministic single objective optimization model were conducted. Results indicated that capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of forecast uncertainty provides informative forecast support. Moreover, noninferior solutions obtained from MOSP dominate the deterministic optimal solution, which could either conserve 4.86 million m 3 (12%) more water without increase in flood risk, or reduce the upstream flood risk by 3.1% without increase in either water scarcity or downstream flood risk during a typical receding flood. The proposed methodology provides a dynamic decision-making modeling tool that could reduce overall risk and determine a compromise for flood water conservation under uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "MP-PCA denoising has become the method of choice for denoising MRI data since it provides an objective threshold to separate the signal components from unwanted thermal noise components. In rodents, thermal noise in the coils is an important source of noise that can reduce the accuracy of activation mapping in fMRI. Further confounding this problem, vendor data often contains zero-filling and other post-processing steps that may violate MP-PCA assumptions. Here, we develop an approach to denoise vendor data and assess activation \"spreading \" caused by MP-PCA denoising in rodent task-based fMRI data. Data was obtained from N = 3 mice using conventional multislice and ultrafast fMRI acquisitions (1 s and 50 ms temporal resolution, respectively), using a visual stimulation paradigm. MP-PCA denoising produced SNR gains of 64% and 39%, and Fourier Spectral Amplitude (FSA) increases in BOLD maps of 9% and 7% for multislice and ultrafast data, respectively, when using a small [2 2] denoising window. Larger windows provided higher SNR and FSA gains with increased spatial extent of activation that may or may not represent real activation. Simulations showed that MP-PCA denoising can incur activation \"spreading \" with increased false positive rate and smoother functional maps due to local \"bleeding \" of principal components, and that the optimal denoising window for improved specificity of functional mapping, based on Dice score calculations, depends on the data's tSNR and functional CNR. This \"spreading \" effect applies also to another recently proposed low-rank denoising method (NORDIC), although to a lesser degree. Our results bode well for enhancing spatial and/or temporal resolution in future fMRI work, while taking into account the sensitivity/specificity trade-offs of low-rank denoising methods.",

We construct a text-based measure of corporate culture for Chinese listed firms and study whether and how strong corporate culture improves corporate resilience during the Sino-US trade war. Empirical analyses suggest that a strong corporate culture mitigates the deteriorating stock returns due to the trade war exposure through two potential influencing mechanisms, enhancing operating performance and mitigating financial constraint. Results also indicate that strong culture works more effectively for privately owned enterprises (POEs) than their state-owned peers, and individual cultures of innovation, hardworking, teamwork, and quality have material effects on stock performance of the POEs.

Recessive mutations of MYO15A are associated with profound, nonsyndromic hearing loss DFNB3 in humans, and deafness and circling behavior in shaker 2 mice. In the inner ear, this motor protein is necessary for the development of hair cell stereocilia, which are actin-filled projections on the apical surface and the site of mechanotransduction of sound.

It is not known whether this large N-terminal extension of myosin XVA is functionally necessary for hearing. We ascertained approximately 600 consanguineous families segregating hereditary hearing loss as a recessive trait and found evidence of linkage of markers at the DFNB3 locus to hearing loss in 38 of these families ascertained in Pakistan (n 5 30), India (n 5 6), and Turkey (n 5 2). In this study, we describe 16 novel recessive mutations of MYO15A associated with severe to profound hearing loss segregating in 20 of these DFNB3-linked families. Importantly, two homozygous mutant allelesc.3313G4T (p.E1105X) and c.3334delG (p.G1112fsX1124) of MYO15A-located in exon 2 are associated with severe to profound hearing loss segregating in two families. These data demonstrate that isoform 1, containing the large N-terminal extension, is also necessary for normal hearing. Hum Mutat 28(10),",

        "abstract": "The Manzanares River is one of the more important rivers of Venezuela inasmuch as it is used to supply drinking water to a large part of the northeastern zone of Venezuela. For this reason a study was undertaken of the surface waters of the estuarine zone of the river, following the saline gradient from zero to salinities greater than 30. The following properties were measured: river volume flow, rainfall, pH, temperature, suspended materials, dissolved oxygen and ammonium, and heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb and Cd) in particulate and dissolved phases. River volume flow varied with seasonal rainfall throughout the year, as expected, while temperature varied between 24.5 and30.4 o C and pH ranged from 6.65 and 8.9. From the dry to the wet season, suspended material increased from 23 to 880 mg/l at low salinity, and always decreased progressively as salinity increased. Concentrations of total ammonium, 14.5 to 14.3 mmol/l, were high, while those of dissolved oxygen, 3.57 to 5.27 ml/l, were low, and these levels were even more accentuated at salinities under 5 during the dry season. The highest concentrations found for heavy metals were: Fe 406.02; Mn 5.57; Zn 2.18; Cu 0.72; Cr 0.19; Ni 0.72; Pb 0.12; Cd 0.03 mmol/l. These surpass Venezuelan legal limits for water intended for human consumption as well as for waters to be discharged in coastal areas. Concentrations decreased at increased salinity because of the dilution effect, flocculation and/or precipitation in the form of oxyhydroxides. The results obtained in this study reveal a serious deterioration of the state of the waters of the lower Manzanares river.",

        "abstract": "Aging is associated with changes in spatial navigation behavior. In addition to an overall performance decline, older adults tend to rely more on proximal location cue information than on environmental boundary information during spatial navigation compared to young adults. The fact that older adults are more susceptible to errors during spatial navigation might be partly attributed to deficient dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal and striatal functioning. Hence, elevating dopamine levels might differentially modulate spatial navigation and memory performance in young and older adults. In this work, we administered levodopa (L-DOPA) in a double-blind within-subject, placebo-controlled design and recorded functional neuroimaging while young and older adults performed a 3D spatial navigation task in which boundary geometry or the position of a location cue were systematically manipulated. An age by intervention interaction on the neural level revealed an upregulation of brain responses in older adults and a downregulation of responses in young adults within the medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus and parahippocampus) and brainstem, during memory retrieval. Behaviorally, L-DOPA had no effect on older adults' overall memory performance; however, older adults whose spatial memory improved under L-DOPA also showed a shift towards more boundary processing under L-DOPA. In young adults, L-DOPA induced a decline in spatial memory performance in task-na\u00efve participants. These results are consistent with the inverted-U-shaped hypothesis of dopamine signaling and cognitive function and suggest that increasing dopamine availability improves hippocampus-dependent place learning in some older adults.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography has yielded intriguing insights into brain circuits and their relationship to behavior in response to gene mutations or neurological diseases across a number of species. Still, existing tractography approaches suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, leading to uncertain interpretation of the reconstructed connections. Hence, in this study, we aimed to optimize the imaging and computational pipeline to achieve the best possible spatial overlaps between the tractography and tracer-based axonal projection maps within the mouse brain corticothalamic network. We developed a dMRI-based atlas of the mouse forebrain with structural labels imported from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (AMBA). Using the atlas and dMRI tractography, we first reconstructed detailed node-to-node mouse brain corticothalamic structural connectivity matrices using different imaging and tractography parameters. We then investigated the effects of each condition for accurate reconstruction of the corticothalamic projections by quantifying the similarities between the tractography and the tracer data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA). Our results suggest that these parameters significantly affect tractography outcomes and our atlas can be used to investigate macroscopic structural connectivity in the mouse brain. Furthermore, tractography in mouse brain gray matter still face challenges and need improved imaging and tractography methods.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of heterogeneous health care data in the last three decades, biomedical ontologies and controlled biomedical terminologies play a more and more important role in knowledge representation and management, data integration, natural language processing, as well as decision support for health information systems and biomedical research. Biomedical ontologies and controlled terminologies are intended to assure interoperability. Nevertheless, the quality of biomedical ontologies has hindered their applicability and subsequent adoption in real-world applications. Ontology evaluation is an integral part of ontology development and maintenance. In the biomedicine domain, ontology evaluation is often conducted by third parties as a quality assurance (or auditing) effort that focuses on identifying modeling errors and inconsistencies. In this work, we first organized four categorical schemes of ontology evaluation methods in the existing literature to create an integrated taxonomy. Further, to understand the ontology evaluation practice in the biomedicine domain, we reviewed a sample of 200 ontologies from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal-the largest repository for biomedical ontologies-and observed that only 15 of these ontologies have documented evaluation in their corresponding inception papers. We then surveyed the recent quality assurance approaches for biomedical ontologies and their use. We also mapped these quality assurance approaches to the ontology evaluation criteria. It is our anticipation that ontology evaluation and quality assurance approaches will be more widely adopted in the development life cycle of biomedical ontologies.",

        "abstract": "Load Theory states that perceptual load prevents, or at least reduces, the processing of task-unrelated stimuli. This study systematically examined the detection and neural processing of auditory stimuli unrelated to a visual foreground task. The visual task was designed to create continuous perceptual load, alternated between low and high load, and contained performance feedback to motivate participants to focus on the visual task instead of the auditory stimuli presented in the background. The auditory stimuli varied in intensity, and participants signaled their subjective perception of these stimuli without receiving feedback. Depending on stimulus intensity, we observed load effects on detection performance and P3 amplitudes of the event-related potential (ERP). N1 amplitudes were unaffected by perceptual load, as tested by Bayesian statistics. Findings suggest that visual perceptual load affects the processing of auditory stimuli in a late time window, which is associated with a lower probability of reported awareness of these stimuli.",

        "abstract": "Brain responses to food are thought to reflect food's rewarding value and to fluctuate with dietary restraint. We propose that brain responses to food are dynamic and depend on attentional focus. Food pictures (highcaloric/low-caloric, palatable/unpalatable) were presented during fMRI-scanning, while attentional focus (hedonic/health/neutral) was induced in 52 female participants varying in dietary restraint. The level of brain activity was hardly different between palatable versus unpalatable foods or high-caloric versus low-caloric foods. Activity in several brain regions was higher in hedonic than in health or neutral attentional focus ( p < .05, FWE-corrected). Palatability and calorie content could be decoded from multi-voxel activity patterns ( p < .05, FDR-corrected). Dietary restraint did not significantly influence brain responses to food. So, level of brain activity in response to food stimuli depends on attentional focus, and may reflect salience, not reward value. Palatability and calorie content are reflected in patterns of brain activity.",

        "title": "Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study",
        "abstract": "Background Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Findings 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u202210, 95% CI 1\u202203-1\u202217, per year increase; p=0\u20220043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u202265, 2\u202261-12\u202223; p<0\u20220001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL (18\u202242, 2\u202264-128\u202255; p=0\u20220033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u20220 days (IQR 17\u20220-24\u20220) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.",

        "abstract": "People with the hearing problems have different listening preferences and characteristics in hearing loss. So, hearing aids need algorithms that provide amplification based on frequency, so that the hearing-impaired persons can use hearing aids comfortably for a long duration. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for hearing aids in order to compensate for sensorineural and conductive hearing loss using discrete cosine transform (DCT). DCT coefficients of the input audio signal are multiplied with uniformly resampled and recursively modified audiogram values to compensate for hearing loss. This algorithm comprised of 4 stages namely precomputation to calculate gain values from audiogram, DCT, gain adjustment, and inverse DCT. In the above stated stages except precomputation, each stage requires only one matrix multiplication, which makes the proposed algorithm computational efficient. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with uniform filter banks, non-uniform filter banks, variable filter bank and reconfigurable filter banks. The algorithm is tested using audiograms with four different hearing loss cases. It is proved that the proposed algorithm provides less complexity, minimized delay and better matching with all types of audiograms, further, it also avoids degradation of audio signal due to sampling rate conversions in variable and reconfigurable filter banks.",
